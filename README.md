# Password Generator

This is a simple password generator script written in Python. It generates random passwords of a specified length using a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.

## Usage

To use the password generator, simply run the `passwordgen.py` script and specify the desired password length as a command-line argument:

```
python passwordgen.py 
```

This will generate a random password of length 9 and print it to the console.

## Requirements

The password generator script requires Python 3.9 to be installed on your system.

## Acknowledgments

This project was inspired by various online tutorials and code snippets for generating random passwords. Special thanks to the Python community for creating such a rich ecosystem of libraries and tools.
