Sure, here's an example README file for a password generator project using Python:

# Password Generator

This is a simple password generator script written in Python. It generates random passwords of a specified length using a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.

## Usage

To use the password generator, simply run the `passwordgen.py` script and specify the desired password length as a command-line argument:

```
python passwordgen.py 9
```

This will generate a random password of length 9 and print it to the console.

## Requirements

The password generator script requires Python 3.x to be installed on your system.
